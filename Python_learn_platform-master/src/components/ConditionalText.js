    <h1>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS IN PYTHON</h1>
    <p>1. Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute code based on whether a condition is True or False.</p>
    <p>2. The most commonly used conditional statements are `if`, `elif`, and `else`.</p>
    <p>3. The `if` statement is used to check a condition. If the condition is True, the block of code within it is executed.</p>
    <p>4. The `elif` statement is used if the previous `if` condition is False, and you need to check another condition.</p>
    <p>5. The `else` statement is executed if none of the `if` or `elif` conditions are True.</p>
    <p>6. Conditions can be combined using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`.</p>
